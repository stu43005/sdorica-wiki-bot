    "Tica: ......",
    "Elio: ......",
    "Yonghyeon: Why don't you say anything! You don't mean—",
    "Li Hwa: Stop shouting, she's all right. She hasn't turned into a monster.",
    "Li Hwa: ...Yet.",
    "Yonghyeon: No... I don't believe it...",
    "Li Hwa: She's delirious and raving... I've seen it so many times. At this point there's nothing we can do for her, and her condition will deteriorate rapidly...",
    "Sad Bewitcher Kid: Waaaah! Sister Soohyeon!!",
    "Yonghyeon: What are you crying for? You think that'll do her any good!?",
    "Sad Bewitcher Kid: Wah... S-sorry...",
    "Li Hwa: I know this is hard to take, Yonghyeon, but try not to get mad.",
    "Yonghyeon: Am I wrong? We don't have time to cry when we could be finding a way to save her...",
    "Juan-Yun: Save her? Is Soohyeon okay?",
    "Tica: Hey, what are you two doing here!?",
    "Elio: Sione's come to check up on me, I'm guessing.",
    "Sione: Yep, this is a business call... I've come from the delegation.",
    "Li Hwa: And you, young Master? Shouldn't you be overseeing the meeting of the Three Sects?",
    "Juan-Yun: After Soohyeon left, General Shun had urgent business to attend to. Rebels from the Insect Tribe are taking advantage of this wave of monsters to further undermine the Alliance.",
    "Juan-Yun: Seeing the tables about to turn, Shun hurried back to the front line with his troops.",
    "Li Hwa: I see...",
    "Juan-Yun: With Soohyeon and General Shun both gone, there was no way for the Meeting of the Three Sects to continue.",
    "Juan-Yun: I couldn't stop worrying about Soohyeon anyway, so I thought I might as well come.",
    "Yonghyeon: Please, my Lord, save Soohyeon!",
    "Juan-Yun: Yonghyeon!? What are you doing here? Get up, at once!",
    "Yonghyeon: No! You're the only one left who can save Soohyeon!",
    "Juan-Yun: I wish there was something I could do for her, but if even Li Hwa hasn't found a way, what could I possibly have to offer...",
    "Elio: ...Wait.",
    "Elio: Tica, did you bring that bottle of Soul Energy with you?",
    "Tica: Oh yeah, I did! I've had it on me the whole time~",
    "Juan-Yun: This is......",
    "Li Hwa: ...the Qi unique to the Beasts.",
    "Li Hwa: After copious experimentation, we've discovered that people turn into Bewitchers because of a mutation in their Qi.",
    "Juan-Yun: What the... Is this true!?",
    "Elio: If we explain it using Rune principles, it appears that for some reason, the Qi originally present in the Bewitchers' Soul Energy sequences has vanished.",
    "Elio: Their transformation into Bewitchers, and eventually into monsters, is a result of their disordered Soul Energy.",
    "Juan-Yun: Uhh, I'm not sure I understand, to be honest... But if you know the cause, can't you find a cure?",
    "Tica: If their Soul Energy's vanished, we'll just top 'em up with some more~ But...",
    "Elio: We've not encountered this new kind of Soul Energy before. We don't know where to find it, or how to reproduce it...",
    "Li Hwa: We have to try. We'll leave no stone unturned in our search for a similar kind of Soul Energy.",
    "Li Hwa: ...But we'll need a lot of time and resources.",
    "Juan-Yun: ...So that's why Soohyeon was trying to persuade them all...",
    "Yonghyeon: I beg you, my Lord! You're the only one they'll listen to!",
    "Yonghyeon: I can't... I can't let anything happen to Soohyeon. I'll do anything to save her!",
    "Juan-Yun: ...Really? Anything?",
    "Yonghyeon: I'll do whatever you say, Lord Juan-Yun, just say the word!",
    "Juan-Yun: —Then become my warrior, and shoulder the destiny of the East!",
    "Yonghyeon: A warrior...?",
    "Juan-Yun: I've consulted with the Aldric envoy to the Kingdom of the Sun. He says a void has opened up in Alliance territory.",
    "Juan-Yun: The Monster of Judgment who guards the void must be sealed away by special means. This has happened before, in Atlas and the Desert Kingdom.",
    "Sione: Did my brother tell you that...?",
    "Elio: Indeed. Dragon Eye, Dragon Tooth, Dragon Wing... But that's all we know so far, and it tells us nothing about the Bewitchers...",
    "Juan-Yun: That's it?",
    "Juan-Yun: All these Bewitchers appearing... Soohyeon's condition worsening... and the Udumbara void opening up—these all happened at the same time.",
    "Juan-Yun: Anybody would think there was some kind of connection between them. What about this Qi mutation you mentioned, do you have any explanation for that?",
    "Tica: Ooh, uhh, well...",
    "Li Hwa: ...We still don't know what's happening. As I said before, we know very little about this new Soul Energy, however—",
    "Juan-Yun: Please, don't misunderstand me. I'm not doubting your research. I just want to point out that it's incomplete.",
    "Yonghyeon: Even so, if it can save Soohyeon—",
    "Juan-Yun: —And if there's not enough time?",
    "Juan-Yun: Li Hwa just told us, we need much more time. But Soohyeon... can she hold on much longer?",
    "Yonghyeon: But... but... What can I...",
    "Juan-Yun: Looks to me like all we can do now is send a hero with the might of the East behind him to defeat the Monster of Judgment.",
    "Juan-Yun: We'll seal him away once more. Soohyeon's life is in the balance.",
    "Li Hwa: Lord Juan-Yun, wait a moment...",
    "Juan-Yun: The other realms have had void crises of their own, and solved them too. This is a lot more realistic than relying on a cure that might not even exist.",
    "Yonghyeon: ......",
    "Juan-Yun: What do you say, Yonghyeon?",
    "Yonghyeon: ...I'm willing to do it. I'd go through hell and back, if it meant Soohyeon could be saved.",
    "Yonghyeon: I, Yonghyeon, place myself at your service, my Lord!",
    "Juan-Yun: Wonderful! That's the Yonghyeon I know.",
    "Juan-Yun: ...As you've all heard, the East is doing all it can to seal away the monsters. We can't afford to get distracted by any more visitors from the Kingdom of the Sun.",
    "Juan-Yun: I'll arrange for you all to leave the East as soon as possible, so that you won't be dragged into any more fighting. Please forgive me.",
    "Elio: Wait! It's not as simple as that! Closing the void is no small task. The Rune Academy has been working on it ever since Atlas went up in flames,",
    "Elio: and even we've only seen the tip of the iceberg. What would the East know... At least wait for Tica and me to return to the Academy and ask for Father's help—",
    "Sione: That... won't be possible.",
    "Tica: Why not?",
    "Tica: Headmaster Ceres knows everything there is to know! Unlike me here~ Don't worry about it~",
    "Sione: No, what I mean is...",
    "Sione: ...Headmaster Ceres is already dead."
