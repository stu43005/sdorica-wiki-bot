    "Gretta: What is it? It's okay, you can tell me anything.",
    "Clan Villager: ...I'm very sorry. We have no news of the Clan Mother. Eidatyr and the others are still making their rounds through the village.",
    "Cautious Clan Villager: ...The Clan Mother went with them of her own free will.",
    "Eidatyr: Free will? Do you even know what you're talking about?",
    "Eidatyr: She'd rather freeze to death in a blizzard than go off with Theodore and that traitor to the clan!",

    "Gretta: I'm sorry... Even if it were me out there, I'd still want us to respect the goddess's wishes.",
    "Gretta: The rituals are held according to the paths of the aurora. The timing is never fixed. The last Lysfete was seven years ago, and then there was another 25 years before that.",
    "Hutchinson: Twenty-five whole years?! That's a long time to be waiting...",
    "Ru-yi: Ooohh! Do you think it was because somebody made the goddess mad?!",
    "Cautious Clan Villager: Don't you understand, Eidatyr? The clan must come first, or the goddess will abandon us.",
    "Eidatyr: Damn you! And damn your stupid rules and traditions! Every damn time, it's the same old excuse!",
    "Cautious Clan Villager: Y-you dare speak against the goddess...",
    "Eidatyr: Grand Sorcerer! Let me ask you something. You've always seen us as children. So what about Valdrir?! Does it serve her right to be kidnapped?",
    "Gretta: ...I know you won't want to hear this, but... all I can do now is trust her.",
    "Gretta: We can't allow one person to bring down the whole clan. As Clan Mother, she sets an example to all the rest of us. She'll make the right choice.",
    "Eidatyr: Enough! I've heard enough of this $*&#!",
    "Eidatyr: I'm a fool for thinking I could reason with you! I'll find her myself! As for all this self-sacrificing for the clan baloney—",
    "Eidatyr: You can take all of that and stuff it where the ice don't melt!!",
    "Gretta: Eidatyr...",
    "Sophie: Let's get going! We have to find Rune and clear this all up!",

    "Clan Villager: May the aurora light the way.",
    "Gretta: May the aurora light the way.",
    "Eidatyr: Grand Sorcerer! Let me ask you something. You've always seen us as children. So what about Valdrir?! Does it serve her right to be kidnapped?",
    "Gretta: ...No. I'm afraid for her too... but...",
    "Gretta: ...If we don't complete the rites of Lysfete, a void will open up in the north, and the entire clan will...",
    "Gretta: (Please... Let us find... our way back home again...)",
    "Izumi: Since you're having such a hard time of it... Why not just destroy the sundial and put everything back on the right track?",
    "Gretta: —Don't touch the sundial!",
    "Izumi: Oooh~ It's been a long time. Aren't you pleased to see me?",
    "Gretta: Why didn't you say you were coming?",
    "Izumi: Eh? Aren't I always welcome?",
    "Izumi: I've finished my business here early, and I'm getting terribly restless!",
    "Gretta: Then you should go back to the sect. I'm too busy for this...",
    "Izumi: Yes, I'll go report back to the True Sun, and what'll I say?",
    "Izumi: Maybe I'll say... No. 5 is having such a wonderful time up here, playing along with the northerners...",
    "Izumi: ...Something to that effect, perhaps?",
    "Gretta: ...What do you want, No. 8?",
    "Izumi: More than twenty years ago now, the sect was to sacrifice the twins to open up the volcano. But one of them went missing, and there was no choice but to abandon the plan.",
    "Gretta: That's all in the past. Like I said at our conference, when Lysfete comes,",
    "Gretta: We'll use the sundial to locate the Mechanical Territory. Even without opening the volcano void, we can—",
    "Izumi: It was you, No. 5, wasn't it?",
    "Izumi: —It was you who spirited the child away from us.",
    "Izumi: That's how far you'd go, to stop the monsters from being released and rampaging over the north... You know, No. 5, you ~really~ love keeping those northerners safe, don't you~",
    "Gretta: ...So what if it was me?!",
    "Gretta: We tried the sacrifice before, and it didn't work!",
    "Gretta: Why, then, would we sacrifice two more children's lives...",
    "Izumi: It wasn't a total failure~ The volcano may not have opened up, but we did get a few more voids out of it.",
    "Izumi: Who knows? Maybe this time it'll be a huge success~",
    "Gretta: Do you realize just how much trouble that void has caused to the northerners? And I have to lie to their faces, saying it's all Vendacti's curse...!",
    "Izumi: Wow~ I'm so touched by your concern for them~ I guess it just doesn't matter if our companions don't ever return home again, right?",
    "Gretta: You know that's not the same...",
    "Izumi: All I know is that if this here sundial were to be destroyed, the look on your face—would be so~ much~ fun~",
    "Gretta: Don't you dare, No. 8! I'm warning you!",
    "Izumi: Oooh, No. 5! I'm so scared~",
    "Izumi: How about this, then. I won't touch your sundial. I'll just massacre all the little northerners instead. Then we won't have anything to argue about, right?",
    "Gretta: Stop playing around!",
    "Izumi: Sounds like a plan to me~",
    "Gretta: Where did all these monsters come from?!",
    "Izumi: Hmph. They really understand the value of good timing~"
