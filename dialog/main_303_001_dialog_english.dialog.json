    "Himawari: (No wonder they're all sucking up to Toyokuni. Still, he doesn't look too impressed...)",
    "Toyokuni: Arbiter Maeok!",
    "Maeok: Y-Yes?",
    "Toyokuni: It's already been an hour. I think we should just get started. ",
    "Maeok: But... we've never begun a meeting without all three mythic chieftains before. I'm worried... ",

    "Tortoise Chieftain: What a thoughtful young man!",
    "Toyokuni: If this is what the Qilin Tribe wishes, then I have no reservations.",
    "Maeok: Well then, today's tri-sect meeting is now officially in session.",
    "Maeok: Will all in attendance please be seated.",
    "Maeok: As I am sure everyone is aware, General Yu has unfortunately passed away—",
    "Shun: What the hell is there to talk about!? Catch that bug and lock her up!",
    "Maeok: Now, we can't just assume Princess Tindoiimu is the culprit...",
    "Shun: Who the hell else would it be!? Her goddam nanny was involved! All those maggots want to do is take the East Alliance for themselves!",
    "Juan Yun: —It wasn't her.",
    "Shun: What did you say?",
    "Juan Yun: I understand everyone's anger, but Princess Tindoiimu did not murder General Yu.",
    "Maeok: And do you have proof, Juan Yun?",
    "Juan Yun: Naturally.",
    "Juan Yun: Soohyeon, I heard you caught a glimpse of the assassin?",
    "Soohyeon: Uh, well... Well, I think so, but I'm not entirely sure...",
    "Soohyeon: At the time, I was dancing for the ceremony up on the stage, and I looked down and saw someone in a purple cape approaching General Yu...",
    "Soohyeon: Then, all of a sudden, the general just collapsed!",
    "Shun: Like hell it wasn't that filthy maggot! There were others at the ceremony who saw those purple-caped killers, too!",
    "Shun: They all pointed them out, and it was clear as day they were part of the Insect Tribe!",
    "Juan Yun: ...Is that so? Soohyeon, did you see the assassin's face?",
    "Soohyeon: ...No... they were hooded...",
    "Seahorse Chieftain: What!? You never even saw their face!?",
    "Soohyeon: After the general fell, everyone panicked, everyone was running... and I thought back to when mother was attacked, and I got scared...",
    "Soohyeon: I was too late to chase them... I'm sorry...",
    "Toyokuni: Juan Yun, I'm afraid this is not adequate evidence. Surely, on motivation alone, there are none with more to gain than those of the Insect Tribe.",
    "Toyokuni: And so it seems that Princess Tindoiimu is still a suspect.",
    "Juan Yun: You need more proof? I have more~",
    "Juan Yun: Soohyeon, when you were up on the altar, you stood quite far from the general.",
    "Juan Yun: It was dark, too... How can you be sure the assassin's cape was purple?",
    "Soohyeon: Huh?",
    "Soohyeon: I don't know... but I remember it so clearly...",
    "Juan Yun: Think back. At the time, apart from the lanterns, was there any other light source?",
    "Soohyeon: Uh...",
    "Soohyeon: Oh yeah! The fireworks!"
