    "???: Yes, it's my fault, I'm very sorry! But, we're really just not open right now...",
    "Guest: Meanwhile I'm here trying to give you business! You should be honored by my presence, you know that!?",

    "Tindoiimu: I just didn't like his tone of voice. I wasn't doing it for you.",

    "Izumi: I saw~ Thanks again, you saved me from having to step in.",
    "Toyokuni: Miss Chiyuki, who is this?",
    "Chiyuki: Everyone, this is Izumi. He owns quite a lot of the establishments here on Hot Spring Street.",
    "Chiyuki: And he also owns the guesthouse you're all staying at.",
    "Pang: Weren't you on the same boat as me while coming over? You're from the Desert Kingdom, right?",
    "Izumi: Ah, the tiger from the ship! What a small world~",
    "Izumi: Now, just to let everyone know, there are some special rules here on Hot Spring Street.",

    "Pang: M-Matchmaker?",
    "Izumi: We're here~",
    "Soohyeon: What a pretty gate~",
    "Tindoiimu: ...I'm a hostage, so it's no wonder I haven't been here, but... Soohyeon, you haven't been here before either?",
    "Soohyeon: My mom is quite protective over me... she doesn't like me running around.",
    "Tindoiimu: ...What about that Yonghyeon? He could always go with you.",
    "Soohyeon: Yonghyeon doesn't like hot springs. I've asked him a million times, he always says no.",
    "Merchant: The Red Palace has all sorts of wonderful charms for sale! Would you like to fall in love? Or maybe get married? Maybe have children!?",
    "Merchant: Charms, necklaces, rings... we've got it all!",
    "Single Lady: Wow, this blue-green charm looks beautiful. Should I buy it?",
    "Soohyeon: Charm...?",
    "Izumi: Yep. Most of the products here ar made by demihumans, especially the charms.",
    "Izumi: Apparently whoever started making these learned from the Rune Academy, over in the Kingdom of the Sun. So the style isn't very 'eastern'.",
    "Izumi: Actually, that decoration on your skirt looks a bit similar.",
    "Soohyeon: (Oh yeah, Li Hwa made this charm, and she studied at the Rune Academy, too...)",
    "Tindoiimu: So your charm is meant for finding love, too?",
    "Soohyeon: Eh!? No!",
    "Tindoiimu: Then what's it for...?",
    "Soohyeon: Uh... it's... uhhhh...",
    "Soohyeon: (I can't tell them what it's actually for...)",
    "Soohyeon: It's not for finding love, it's... it's actually kind of an anti-love charm!",
    "Tindoiimu: ......",
    "Soohyeon: Um, I mean... think about it, Tindoiimu...",
    "Soohyeon: Juan-Yun has always been a kind of flirty guy with everyone, hasn't he?",
    "Tindoiimu: ……………",
    "Soohyeon: I've always wanted him to stop all that... I've tried almost every kind of love curse out there, so I thought...",
    "Soohyeon: Maybe I should try one of these anti-love charms that the humans make, you know?",
    "Tindoiimu: Uh-huh... You two are getting married, so it makes sense.",
    "Soohyeon: ...Tindoiimu? What's wrong? Did I say something to upset you?",
    "Tindoiimu: No, I'm fine...\nI wish you both the best."
