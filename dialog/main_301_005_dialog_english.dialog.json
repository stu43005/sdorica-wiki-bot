    "Diplomatic Ambassador: Impudence! If we had not shown such great mercy, the heinous crimes of the tiger king would have sent the Tiger Tribe to—",
    "Kong Maeok: O-Okay! Enough! We're just here to look around.",
    "Kong Maeok: General Yu, since you are responsible for supervising the Insect Tribe, please lead the way.",
