    "Guesthouse Boss: When a woman is sold to Hot Spring Street, she cuts all ties with family! I'd never let her go back home!",

    "Merchant: As long as they think they'll go home one day, they'll do anything I say!",
    "Guesthouse Boss: And when it's someone as good as Bluebird, I've got to pull out all the stops. I've written so many letters my hand's about to fall off.",

    "Beyata: (Has he been forging letters in my grandfather's name? Ah... he must be doing that because he cares about me!)",

    "Orisuke: Oh, crap... Ah, we...",
    "Orisuke: Here, a gift for you... on me!",
    "Orisuke: I was simply lost, so lost this little lady here had to come find me! Please don't speak of this to anyone else, I'd be so embarrassed...",
    "Cruel Staff: Yes, of course... You two were in your room the whole time, you didn't see anything~",
    "Orisuke: Bluebird, how about we head to the bath?",
    "Beyata: Yes, Mr. Orisuke...",
    "Orisuke: I'm sure that was hard for you to hear, Bluebird... If you want, I can leave and come back another time...",
    "Orisuke: M-Maybe your grandfather just left to take care of some business, and he's still going to come back for you. Don't lose hope...",
    "Beyata: ...You're very kind, Mr. Orisuke.",
    "Beyata: ...But I heard it from the boss, loud and clear. My grandfather sold me, then took the money and disappeared.",
    "Beyata: My grandfather... betrayed me.",
    "Beyata: The boss isn't the same. He took me in when no one wanted me, he's taken care of me... and he needs me!",
    "Beyata: And you, too, Mr. Orisuke. You've been so nice to me~",
    "Beyata: Everything is fine. As long as I'm still needed, then I am fine~",

    "Beyata: Yaagh, I'm sorry! I-I mean, he might have withheld some of the truth from me... but he was just trying to protect me.",
    "Beyata: That's more than I could have hoped for, since I'm a cursed, wretched girl who doesn't deserve happiness...",
    "Orisuke: ...Bluebird...",
    "Orisuke: You know, when I was selling my cloth, one of my customers told me of you. He said there were legends of you...",
    "Orisuke: The legends said your feathers could bring people happiness.",
    "Beyata: There are legends about me? And they say I make people... happy?",
    "Beyata: That's impossible... I don't believe it...",
    "Orisuke: You just ran into some bad luck, but you're not \"cursed\". It's like how I can't help but eat a bit too much, and others laugh at me for it...",
    "Orisuke: But I still have self worth, I'm not useless! Don't be so down on yourself!",
    "Beyata: Mr. Orisuke, you... you're the first person to tell me that I make others happy.",
    "Beyata: But... I don't think I have what it takes to be as brave as you.",
    "Orisuke: What do you mean!? Of course you can! And with me here, you don't have anything to worry about!",
    "Beyata: D-Do you mean... you're going to take me away from this place?",
    "Orisuke: ...Eh? N-No, I just─",
    "Orisuke: I mean... maybe if I get that contract with the arbiter next month, then I might be able to make enough money to buy your freedom, but...",
    "Beyata: You're not lying to me, are you?",
    "Orisuke: I mean, I can't promise─",
    "Orisuke: I, I mean, no I'm not lying! I promise I will take you away from Hot Spring Street!",
    "Orisuke: You can trust me, Bluebird. And you don't have to pretend around me, anymore, you can be yourself.",
    "Beyata: Oh, thank you, Mr. Orisuke! You've made me so happy, I don't have any reason to be sad any─",
