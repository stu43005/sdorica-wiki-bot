    "Law: Then maybe Sennosuke would not be the scoundrel he is today!",

    "Pang: Eh? What is it, then?",
    "Yan-Bo: It is the Capybara Tribe's holy talisman. I just never returned it to the Alliance.",
    "Pang: The capybara have their own holy talisman!?",

    "Yan-Bo: My actions led to the fall of my entire tribe, and yet I did nothing to stop Sennosuke.",
    "Yan-Bo: I only ran away, a coward...",
    "Pang: Master Yan-Bo...",

    "Yan-Bo: I gave it to you, hoping that when Maeok saw it, it would stir something in her, and she would help you.",

    "Yan-Bo: I think it is about time I go back to Maple Lake.",

    "Yan-Bo: I am! I have entrusted Sharice with looking after the lake in my absence, but I'm afraid I should really get back there myself.",
    "Pang: Sharice, huh?",
    "Yan-Bo: That child pretends like she is not worried, then runs over and asks me every day if I've heard any news about you all.",
    "Yan-Bo: She's a good kid, that Sharice.",
    "Pang: Well, then please apologize to her for—",
    "Pang: ...No, actually, I will apologize to her myself on my return.",

    "Law: Well isn't Soohyeon a nice girl! How about Miranda and Yota?",
    "Soohyeon: Please don't worry, Mr. Law. The Alliance is scheduling a time for you to go see them yourself.",
    "Pang: Well, then, Master Yan-Bo and I will—",
    "Jia-Shen: Now hold on! Those three haven't seen each other in a long time now, they've definitely got a lot to talk about...",
    "Pang: ...Well then, we should probably be leaving.",
    "Soohyeon: I've brought some wine and snacks for everyone~",
    "Law: Ah, how long has it been since us three could chat over drinks like this?",
    "Yan-Bo: I would say about twenty-two years.",
    "Maeok: ...Twenty-three years, actually.",
    "Maeok: You left twenty-three years ago, Yan-Bo.",

    "Maeok: Of course we did! I...",
    "Maeok: I was even mad at you for a bit. I was going to really give you a piece of my mind if I ever saw you again, but...",
    "Maeok: I'm old now, and it's getting tougher and tougher to have reunions like this. Plus, you've been gone for twenty-three years...",
    "Maeok: So I've left behind that anger. All I want to do now is have a good chat with my friends.",
    "Maeok: Yan-Bo, I was thinking that after the new arbiter takes over, I could pay a visit to you at Maple Lake.",
    "Yan-Bo: Of course! Maple Lake is pretty as a picturebook... After I started living there, I could only think of how much you and Law would love it.",
    "Law: It is quite striking, that Maple Lake. I remember the first time I went there, when Yan-Bo and I were walking along the water..."
