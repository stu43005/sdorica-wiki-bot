    "Female Villager: If not for the school, just taking care of the kids would leave me no time to even buy groceries!",
    "Angelia: Never thought a decorated military advisor would start a village school after his retirement.",
    "Female Villager: No kidding. An ex-kingdom minister willingly came to this remote village; it really scared us back then",
    "Naya: Was Hyde there back then as well?",
    "Female Villager: He's an orphan adopted by Sir Nikola..",
    "Female Villager: Even though he's an orphan, Sir treated him like his own son; even taught Hyde all the knowledge he acquired in his lifetime!",

    "Bandit: Woman, behave and give us your money, or else...",
    "Naya: We're having a proper conversation; so take your troublemaking somewhere else!",

    "Naya: I dare you to come back. I'll always be here to kick your ***!",

    "Hyde: Why are you two the ones acting surprised?",
    "Hyde: This village is remote, doesn't mean we don't know about major events. Also, your glowing hair and the grace you have are difficult to hide from Hyde.",
    "Naya: During our stay in the Slums, no one saw through this disguise for several months. You have quite the keen eye...",
    "Angelia: If that's the case, you must already know about the purpose of my visit, right?",
    "Hyde: You want Master Nikola to come out of retirement to assist you in your war against Theodore, but Master's passing threw a wrench into your plans.",
    "Hyde: So now, you want to ask me to help out Sunshine Infantry, right?",
    "Angelia: Yes, you're right. Then, Sir Hyde, your answer is...",
    "Hyde: I'm sorry, but I refuse.",
    "Angelia: Why !?",
    "Naya: Yeah, aren't you Nikola's disciple?",
    "Naya: Then you should know that Theodore is an absolute villain, and that Angel is the true successor to the throne, shouldn't you?",
    "Hyde: Apologies, but all I want to do is to look over the brats and live a peaceful life. I have no interest in getting involved in political conflicts.",
    "Angelia: Please Sir, please reconsider. I...",
    "Hyde: Ladies, you've been here long enough. Please leave.",
