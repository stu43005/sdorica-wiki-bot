    "Juan-Yun: ...I see. Let us continue, then.",
    "Juan-Yun: First, this booby-trapped box.",
    "Juan-Yun: From what you've told me, it combines the sorcery of the Qilin Tribe with an induction device designed with Miss Tica's knowledge of the Runes.",
    "Juan-Yun: So, did it work?",
    "Toyokuni: Yes. I took a detour while I was making my escape, just to confirm it.",
    "Toyokuni: ...But even with such traps, our enemies are too powerful...",
    "Juan-Yun: Yes, I don't believe us capable of defeating the Monster of Judgment.",
    "Toyokuni: Please elaborate.",
    "Juan-Yun: I don't wish to defeat it, but to—capture it.",
    "Juan-Yun: Before you came, Toyokuni, I was explaining this to Himawari and Yonghyeon. This is an ancient book of strategy handed down through the Qilin Tribe. Please, take a look...",
    "Juan-Yun: This ancient tome records that the Holy Dragon of old rebuilt the world,",
    "Juan-Yun: and to guard against any remnants of the evil dragon that might re-emerge, it left behind the barrier of the Three Sects and their corresponding stones...",
    "Toyokuni: I've heard of this. The city wall of the Three Sects was also built for this very reason.",
    "Juan-Yun: Correct. And so we must abide by the old ways. We must awaken the barrier stones and erect the barrier of the Three Sects once more!",
    "Yonghyeon: But the Alliance has been flooded with monsters...",
    "Toyokuni: Right! So you had that Rune scholar set a trap...",
    "Toyokuni: So that the monsters would be drawn out of the Alliance, and our people would be able to get back in and raise the barrier?",
    "Juan-Yun: That's right... But there are too many of them. It won't be possible to draw them all away.",
    "Juan-Yun: Furthermore, this means that we'll need one of us to act as a decoy and stay outside to draw the monsters' attention...",
    "Juan-Yun: We'll have to sacrifice a lot for this one battle...",
    "Yonghyeon: ...Don't be disheartened, Juan-Yun. We've all made up our minds to follow your lead.",
    "Toyokuni: Indeed. And you... Have you not changed your mind, Juan-Yun? You... were not born a warrior. Must you insist on going down this path with us?",
    "Toyokuni: If it's all just to preserve the Qilin bloodline, why not—",
    "Juan-Yun: Thank you for your concern, Toyokuni. I know that I cannot call myself a warrior.",
    "Toyokuni: Please don't misunderstand, I'm not...",
    "Juan-Yun: I know you're only thinking of me, Toyokuni.",
    "Juan-Yun: —But I have to fight, alongside everyone else.",
    "Himawari: Juan-Yun!!",
    "Juan-Yun: I've come this far already, so that my homeland might be saved. Please... allow me to witness that with my own eyes!",
    "Yonghyeon: ...Juan-Yun should be the one to lead the East. He's made his position clear, and we mustn't question it.",
    "Yonghyeon: Take a look, Juan-Yun. We're all at your command, ready to slaughter those monsters!",
    "Juan-Yun: Yonghyeon...",
    "Toyokuni: ...You have the soul of a sage. How could I not go with you! So, come what may, we'll face it together!",
    "Himawari: (...Juan-Yun...)",
    "Toyokuni: Shun and the others were waylaid by Insect soldiers. They probably won't make it here in time.",
    "Juan-Yun: I didn't expect them to catch us up. But it's too bad General Shun and the Bulls can't be with our forces...",
    "Juan-Yun: —We'll have to go on with the original plan. Prepare yourselves, everyone!",
    "Himawari: ......",
    "Juan-Yun: Miss Tica, please get some more traps ready!",
    "Tica: One Tica special, coming right up! I've got a lot of these boxes to deal with, so I'll need some time to tweak them properly~",
    "Sione: We'll lend a hand.",
    "Juan-Yun: (...At this rate, we'll be ready in no time at all...)",
    "???: ...True Sun, are you sure you don't need our help?",
    "Juan-Yun: The Monsters of Judgment make their reckonings on behalf of Sdorica, whereas the Alliance forces are mere mortals. They're nothing compared to Sdorica.",
    "Dracontine: But the barrier left behind by the Keeper of the Udumbara...",
    "Juan-Yun: The Keeper I knew... was no expert when it came to Barrier Runes. Even if he left a barrier behind, it wouldn't have proved effective.",
    "Dracontine: In the beginning, you wanted to stop them from learning about Eternal Night Soul Energy. That's why you scrapped the plan to use elite warriors, so that their attention would be distracted.",
    "Dracontine: Now that objective has been achieved, why not give the order to have your subordinates slaughter them all...",
    "Juan-Yun: ...Could you really be capable of killing every Easterner there is?",
    "Dracontine: I don't know what you mean, True Sun...",
    "Juan-Yun: Some people will never give up hope, no matter how many times they get knocked down.",
    "Juan-Yun: But if you let them believe they'll win, so they spend every last drop of effort, before you thrash them to pieces... Then they'll give up on everything.",
    "Dracontine: I see... I hadn't thought it through.",
    "Juan-Yun: Go now. Don't let anyone see you.",
    "Dracontine: Understood.",
    "Himawari: Who are you!?",
    "Dracontine: Dammit...!",
    "Juan-Yun: Himawari? Why aren't you with the others...",
    "Himawari: Hmph, I've had enough of them.",
    "Himawari: I came to urge you to leave. And thank goodness I did~",
    "Himawari: Speak! What have you been up to, secretly pulling Juan-Yun aside and conferring with him all this time?",
    "Himawari: I'll skin you alive if you so much as touch him!",
    "Dracontine: Gwah...",
    "Juan-Yun: ......",
    "Toyokuni: ...Has anyone seen Juan-Yun and Himawari?",
    "Tica: No? Ah, maybe they're over there?\nGo take a look, I'll keep working here~",
    "Juan-Yun: (Those two from the Kingdom of the Sun are sure to recognize a Dracontine...)",
    "Himawari: Those fools have finally figured it out. And just in time! Go speak to them, Juan-Yun, it's danger...",
    "Himawari: Juan...Yun...?",
    "Juan-Yun: ...The real Juan-Yun's always been so lonely. If he had a sister like you, he'd care for you so much...",
    "Himawari: I... J-Juan...",
    "Juan-Yun: ...Shh, sleep now.",
    "Toyokuni: What...! What's happened!?",
    "Juan-Yun: Himawari... She was trying to protect me from this intruder... and then...",
    "Sione: That outfit... That's a Dracontine...! What's he doing here...!?",
    "Yonghyeon: A Dracontine? Is this connected with the Holy Dragon? But—",
    "Sione: That sound... Miss Chevalier's traps are set!",
    "Toyokuni: Has it begun already... or...",
    "Juan-Yun: We have to prioritize the plan...",
    "Juan-Yun: I know everybody's upset and agitated right now. But... the fate of the East... is in our hands...",
    "Juan-Yun: Please... for Himawari's sake...",
    "Toyokuni: ...Leave it to us.",
    "Toyokuni: Everyone, get in position!"
