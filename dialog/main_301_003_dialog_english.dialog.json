    "Diplomat: Men!",
    "Tindoiimu: I told you this would never work...",
    "Juan Yun: Yep... definitely not working out like I thought it would.",

    "Juan Yun: I'm sure that the arbiter's heart is as lovely as her looks. She must understand.",
    "Maeok: Is the qilin chieftain aware of this?",
    "Juan Yun: I'm not sure. But father is on a faraway journey. Naturally, his son should handle the tribe's affairs.",
    "Diplomat: As a descendent of mythics, we must respect you to some degree... but as for whether or not you may act as deputy... ",
    "Diplomat: We'd have to see if you've inherited enough mythic energy. Otherwise—",
    "Maeok: Sir, be careful with your words.",
    "Juan Yun: To be frank, I know I don't have the best reputation.",

    "Juan Yun: Wind, fog, water...",
    "Juan Yun: Hundreds of years ago, there existed three mythical factions. Embroiled in battle, they disturbed and angered the holy dragon.",
    "Juan Yun: Were it not for the holy dragon's order for each faction to put aside disagreements... \n\n...to instead work together to better this great land... then the Alliance would not be as it is today.",
    "Juan Yun: And though the Insect Tribe may not be beasts, they are part of the Alliance now, too.",
    "Juan Yun: As a descendant of mythics, it is my responsibility to uphold peace in the east. To treat everyone as equals.",
    "Juan Yun: This is the true calling of the mythics.",

    "Maeok: After hearing Lord Juan Yun's words, would anybody like to add anything?",

    "Diplomat: Hmph...",
    "Maeok: If not, then as arbiter of the Alliance, I hereby allow the insect princess to go on this journey. \n\nHowever, no attendants will be allowed. Alliance bodyguards will be sent for protection.",

    "Juan Yun: Yeah, it...*gasp*... really took the wind out of me...",
    "Juan Yun: ...Such a wimpy little breeze, too...",
    "Juan Yun: Now you see why dad has to look outside the tribe for... a competitor for the... Martial Arts Tournament...",
    "Maeok: Foolish child! Everyone's fate is different! I have not turned my back on you! If I had, would I really give you my only daughter's hand?",
    "Juan Yun: I know... You treat me so well...!",
    "Maeok: This will not do! I shall call for the Alliance physician!",
    "Maeok: Come! Call the doctor—",
    "Soohyeon: I've already called for him.",
    "Tindoiimu: Kong Soohyeon...?",
    "Tindoiimu: Why is there a veil over your face...?",
    "Jiyanama: I heard this has been the tradition of the Water Sect for generations...",
    "Jiyanama: Once a woman has found a suitor for marriage, she musn't show her face until she has been formally married.",
    "Tindoiimu: I haven't seen her for so long. She's...",
    "Jiyanama: It appears there have been talks to establish a relationship with the Qilin Tribe via marriage. \n\nThe qilin—mythical beasts of wind, and the kyo—beasts of water...",
    "Jiyanama: Well-matched for marriage, indeed.",
    "Tindoiimu: .........",
    "Physician: No need to worry. Our lord just over-exerted himself. He will be fine.",
    "Maeok: Wonderful!",
    "Physician: Please give me some time to smooth out the lord's qi.",

    "Maeok: Soohyeon! Listening in on other's conversations again, are we!?",
    "Maeok: Haven't I warned you? People of the Alliance all have their own agendas! You can't keep running over here!",
    "Soohyeon: But the princess is going on a journey. How could I not see her off?",
    "Soohyeon: Anyway, I've known everyone since I was a baby! They're like family! Nothing bad'll happen~",
    "Maeok: Child, you've never encountered a bad person...",
    "Jiyanama: Princess, your humble servant has something to ask of you.",
    "Tindoiimu: What is it?",
    "Jiyanama: My son Faayida will soon be eleven. He will undergo the Metamorphosis...",

    "Tindoiimu: .........",
    "Tindoiimu: ...Let me see it.",
    "Tindoiimu: Is this... an ornament from the East Alliance?",

    "Jiyanama: Princess...?",
    "Tindoiimu: ...Don't worry. I will certainly give it to him for you.",

    "Soohyeon: Ah, mom! Nothing, nothing!",
    "Soohyeon: Well... I was just thinking... ",
    "Soohyeon: Everyone says adopted children love their parents more than biological children do... \n\nBut why is it when it comes to how parents treat their children, they always treat their own children better?",
    "Maeok: Child, always asking strange questions...",
    "Maeok: It's not so much that parents love their own children more... They just miss the children who aren't by their side~",
    "Maeok: You will understand when you have a child of your own.",
    "Soohyeon: ...Really...?",
