    "Nigel: I recruited my friends in the Slums to come here and wipe out the remaining monsters in Atlas.",
    "Nigel: That way, the demihumans who have been living under discrimination for so long can finally come back and live here again!",
    "Sherlock: So that's why you turned this abandoned castle into your temporary base of operations? My, my, that's some hardcore recycling~",
    "Nigel: Now, it's my turn to ask questions. What are you guys doing here?",

    "Angelia: Naya, stop it. I'm fine.",

    "Angelia: Seeing that the castle is now under your control, I must now ask for your assistance.",

    "Angelia: I intend to reboot the Rayzor and use it against Theodore!",
    "Sherlock: Eh!? Is that the reason why you coerced me to come here?",
    "Angelia: Correct. The Rayzor was designed in the Mechanical Territory.",
    "Angelia: Therefore, as a native of the Mechanical Territory, you're the only one I can ask to inspect the Rayzor to see if it was damaged when the castle crashed.",
    "Nigel: He said you coerced him? You've learned to blackmail people now?",
    "Angelia: In order to fight against Theodore, it's a choice I had to make.",
    "Nigel: So your choice is to follow in Theodore's footsteps, take the Rayzor, massacre Theodore's forces, then take back the throne?",
    "Angelia: I don't want to do this, but war will always have casualties no matter what...",
    "Naya: Angel...",
    "Nigel: Then what happens after you take back the throne?\nAttack the Bears with the Rayzor? Or worse, attack Atlas again?",
    "Angelia: NO! I would never do such things...",

    "Elio: I think...it's probably some technical terms decipherable by mechanicians.",
    "Izumi: Well, even though I can't understand what this robot is saying~ both Nigel and princess could understand what I was saying, fortunately~",
    "Nigel: ... Are you done thinking about it? If you want me to let you take away the Rayzor, you have to agree to the three conditions I just stated.",
    "Angelia: Leave the blueprints behind so you know Rayzor's weaknesses and how to counter it, help you wipe out the nearby monsters...",
    "Angelia: ...and unlock the treasure vault and gift the treasures inside to Atlas as funds for reconstruction. Right?",
    "Naya: Hmph, so you get all the benefits and we get basically nothing...",
    "Angelia: It's ok. I agree to your conditions.",
    "Nigel: Been a while since I last saw you. So you now have the ability to negotiate and analyze deals now...",
    "Nigel: Wait, Yamitsuki? What's the matter?",
    "Izumi: Ah, Yamitsuki here is probably in a bad mood~ Is it because Nigel actually did what I said?",
    "Nigel: ......",
    "Sherlock: Inspection complete~ I expect no less from a design by the Mechanical Territory! Little to no damage was done to it.",
    "Sherlock: However, it's impossible to take it away from here. You better give up on that.",
    "Sherlock: My job is done here. See ya guys~",
    "Angelia: No need to hurry. Your real mission is just about to begin.",
    "Sherlock: WHAT!?",
    "Angelia: Do you really think I didn't expect this? The Rayzor is a massive weapon. Even if the entire structure was intact, it would be difficult for me to take it away. ",
    "Angelia: Therefore, I need you to come up with an alternative plan.",
    "Naya: Or you can go back to the Bazaar and find that you've been stripped of your vice presidency. That works for me too~",
    "Sherlock: Meeting you people is definitely the worst thing to happen in my life! I'm certain of that now!",
    "Sherlock: ...You can't take the whole thing away, but a modification might just work.",
    "Angelia: Modify the Rayzor?",
    "Sherlock: Remove the driver core from the mainframe, then modify the core into a more lightweight weapon.",
    "Nigel: If we do that, the Rayzor's power...",
    "Sherlock: Of course, it won't maintain its previous destructive power~",
    "Sherlock: However, while it may no longer be the WMD capable of wiping out a country, it's still more than enough to blast several armies to kingdom come~",
    "Angelia: Understood. Then Sir Sherlock, please proceed with the modifications.",
    "Angelia: How much time do you need?",
    "Sherlock: Just removing the core alone is about a whole day's work.",
