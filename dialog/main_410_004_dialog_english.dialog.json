    "Adelaide: Father...! How did you...?!",

    "Angelia: Naya, stop.",
    "Naya: Angelia?",
    "Angelia: There's nowhere to run. Let us talk, Head Serafin.",
    "Serafin Head: ...It's truly wonderful that you've understood your circumstances with such clarity, Your Majesty. However, with things as they currently stand, the time for discussions is already past.",
    "Serafin Head: Please return the Queen to the palace.",
    "Angelia: Everyone has their price. It's just a matter of whether it can be afforded or not. I'm curious as to what it would take to buy you.",
    "Angelia: —Name your price.",
    "Serafin Head: ......",
    "Serafin Head: ...You sound just like your uncle.",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Serafin Head: But from where I stand, you don't have many cards left to play. Whatever makes you think I'd negotiate with you now?",
    "Angelia: I'm still alive, and that alone proves I'm of value to you. Perhaps you shouldn't be so sure of the cards I'm holding.",
    "Serafin Head: ......",
    "Serafin Head: Heh... I'm sorry, how rude of me. I'm always underestimating you, Your Majesty.",
    "Serafin Head: The former regent never staked all he had on one throw of the dice. He was always balancing every win and loss. But this courageousness... is something he always lacked...",
    "Serafin Head: ...All right. As you wish. Let us talk. You've already proved yourself worthy of it.",
    "Angelia: Then...",
    "Serafin Head: But permit me to be blunt. I'm afraid you are mistaken, Your Majesty. I was never bought by the Dracontines.",
    "Angelia: But... then... What about Adelaide? Are they using her to threaten you?",
    "Serafin Head: ......",
    "Angelia: But even if you listen to them, the sect will never stop—",
    "Serafin Head: ...Every life is filled with suffering. The question is how to compromise. It's time that you learned this lesson, Your Majesty.",
    "Serafin Head: Now.",
    "Naya: Oof!!",
    "Angelia: Naya!",
    "Serafin Head: Relax, Your Majesty. That wound may be painful, but won't be of any consequence... As for the next one, we can't be so sure.",
    "Angelia: Serafin!! What are you up to?",
    "Serafin Head: Who sits upon the Sun Throne is of no matter to the Dracontines. All they want is monarch with an agreeable ear.",
    "Serafin Head: If nobody is willing to listen, the Kingdom will be plunged into civil war.",
    "Serafin Head: So, Your Majesty, what's it going to be? Your only card now is to work together with the sect.",
    "Naya: Ungh...!",
    "Angelia: Naya! Are you all right?! Naya!!",
    "Naya: I'm... fine... It's not a mortal wound... Don't... let him... fool you. You mustn't... do as the Dracontines say...",
    "Angelia: Naya...",
    "Serafin Head: On the contrary, I think that's a perfect suggestion for all involved.",
    "Serafin Head: The former regent hated the sect with every bone in his body. They could never have trusted him. If you'd be more amenable to their aims, however, the risks would be far smaller.",
    "Serafin Head: It's within my power to placate the Twelve Noble Houses and restore their allegiance.",
    "Angelia: What... What should I do?",
    "Serafin Head: That's simple. All you must do, Your Majesty, is send your forces to annihilate Atlas. This would be enough to prove your resolve to the Twelve Houses.",
    "Serafin Head: As for the rest... You can leave that to me.",
    "Angelia: You'd have me go to war, all for your own vanity and reputation? I could never agree to such a thing!",
    "Serafin Head: If you don't declare war on Atlas, then a civil war awaits you at home. It won't be the demihumans dying, but your own people. Would you prefer that?",
    "Angelia: How could you...!",
    "Serafin Head: Let me remind you that even with Dylan Levon and House Aldric behind you, how much of a chance do you stand against the allied armies of the Twelve Noble Houses?",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Serafin Head: If Theodore wins, perhaps you could cling to life, too. But what about them? Well, would you rather join Theodore's side?",
    "Angelia: (Join with Theodore... It's not an impossibility. But if it came to it, I'd have to give up the throne.)",
    "Angelia: (So even if he wins, all our efforts will have come to nothing...)",
    "Serafin Head: The monarch must be willing to make compromises and concessions in order to achieve what is best and what is right. Theodore knew this, as must any king or queen. There are no exceptions.",
    "Naya: Guh!",
    "Angelia: Naya! Wake up!",
    "Serafin Head: Heh. Your most beloved companion is at death's door, Your Majesty. And you still insist on speaking for the demihumans, they who are nothing to you?",
    "Angelia: Serafin! This is... unforgiveable!!",
    "Serafin Head: Yes, I know. I also know how the demihumans see us.",
    "Serafin Head: No matter what benevolence or kindness you show them, Your Majesty, Atlas will always see the Kingdom as enemies and regard us with hatred.",
    "Serafin Head: And still you help them, out of your own ideals. Do you really expect this enmity to end, after they've threatened our Kingdom for so many generations?",
    "Angelia: No... I... You're wrong...",
    "Serafin Head: Everyone is selfish. I am, and you are, too.",
    "Serafin Head: There are no perfect choices, Angelia. Proud Queen that you are, please make your decisions wisely...",
