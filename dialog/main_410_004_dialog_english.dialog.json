    "Adelaide: Father...! How did you...?!",
    "Lord Serafin: Enough. Guards, please escort them back.",
    "Naya: Get behind me, Angelia!",

    "Angelia: Naya, stop.",
    "Naya: Angelia?",
    "Angelia: There's nowhere to run. Let us talk, Head Serafin.",
    "Lord Serafin: ...It's truly wonderful that you've understood your circumstances with such clarity, Your Majesty. However, with things as they currently stand, the time for discussions is already past.",
    "Lord Serafin: Please return the Queen to the palace.",
    "Angelia: Everyone has their price. It's just a matter of whether it can be afforded or not. I'm curious as to what it would take to buy you.",
    "Angelia: —Name your price.",
    "Lord Serafin: ......",
    "Lord Serafin: ...You sound just like your uncle.",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Lord Serafin: But from where I stand, you don't have many cards left to play. Whatever makes you think I'd negotiate with you now?",
    "Angelia: I'm still alive, and that alone proves I'm of value to you. Perhaps you shouldn't be so sure of the cards I'm holding.",
    "Lord Serafin: ......",
    "Lord Serafin: Heh... I'm sorry, how rude of me. I'm always underestimating you, Your Majesty.",
    "Lord Serafin: The former regent never staked all he had on one throw of the dice. He was always balancing every win and loss. But this courageousness... is something he always lacked...",
    "Lord Serafin: ...All right. As you wish. Let us talk. You've already proved yourself worthy of it.",
    "Angelia: Then...",
    "Lord Serafin: But permit me to be blunt. I'm afraid you are mistaken, Your Majesty. I was never bought by the Dracontines.",
    "Angelia: But... then... What about Adelaide? Are they using her to threaten you?",
    "Lord Serafin: ......",
    "Angelia: But even if you listen to them, the sect will never stop—",
    "Lord Serafin: ...Every life is filled with suffering. The question is how to compromise. It's time that you learned this lesson, Your Majesty.",
    "Lord Serafin: Now.",
    "Naya: Oof!!",
    "Angelia: Naya!",
    "Lord Serafin: Relax, Your Majesty. That wound may be painful, but won't be of any consequence... As for the next one, we can't be so sure.",
    "Angelia: Serafin!! What are you up to?",
    "Lord Serafin: Who sits upon the Sun Throne is of no matter to the Dracontines. All they want is monarch with an agreeable ear.",
    "Lord Serafin: If nobody is willing to listen, the Kingdom will be plunged into civil war.",
    "Lord Serafin: So, Your Majesty, what's it going to be? Your only card now is to work together with the sect.",
    "Naya: Ungh...!",
    "Angelia: Naya! Are you all right?! Naya!!",
    "Naya: I'm... fine... It's not a mortal wound... Don't... let him... fool you. You mustn't... do as the Dracontines say...",
    "Angelia: Naya...",
    "Lord Serafin: On the contrary, I think that's a perfect suggestion for all involved.",
    "Lord Serafin: The former regent hated the sect with every bone in his body. They could never have trusted him. If you'd be more amenable to their aims, however, the risks would be far smaller.",
    "Lord Serafin: It's within my power to placate the Twelve Noble Houses and restore their allegiance.",
    "Angelia: What... What should I do?",
    "Lord Serafin: That's simple. All you must do, Your Majesty, is send your forces to annihilate Atlas. This would be enough to prove your resolve to the Twelve Houses.",
    "Lord Serafin: As for the rest... You can leave that to me.",
    "Angelia: You'd have me go to war, all for your own vanity and reputation? I could never agree to such a thing!",
    "Lord Serafin: If you don't declare war on Atlas, then a civil war awaits you at home. It won't be the demihumans dying, but your own people. Would you prefer that?",
    "Angelia: How could you...!",
    "Lord Serafin: Let me remind you that even with Dylan Levon and House Aldric behind you, how much of a chance do you stand against the allied armies of the Twelve Noble Houses?",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Lord Serafin: If Theodore wins, perhaps you could cling to life, too. But what about them? Well, would you rather join Theodore's side?",
    "Angelia: (Join with Theodore... It's not an impossibility. But if it came to it, I'd have to give up the throne.)",
    "Angelia: (So even if he wins, all our efforts will have come to nothing...)",
    "Lord Serafin: The monarch must be willing to make compromises and concessions in order to achieve what is best and what is right. Theodore knew this, as must any king or queen. There are no exceptions.",
    "Naya: Guh!",
    "Angelia: Naya! Wake up!",
    "Lord Serafin: Heh. Your most beloved companion is at death's door, Your Majesty. And you still insist on speaking for the demihumans, they who are nothing to you?",
    "Angelia: Serafin! This is... unforgiveable!!",
    "Lord Serafin: Yes, I know. I also know how the demihumans see us.",
    "Lord Serafin: No matter what benevolence or kindness you show them, Your Majesty, Atlas will always see the Kingdom as enemies and regard us with hatred.",
    "Lord Serafin: And still you help them, out of your own ideals. Do you really expect this enmity to end, after they've threatened our Kingdom for so many generations?",
    "Angelia: No... I... You're wrong...",
    "Lord Serafin: Everyone is selfish. I am, and you are, too.",
    "Lord Serafin: There are no perfect choices, Angelia. Proud Queen that you are, please make your decisions wisely...",
