    "Angelia: I'm fine. I'm just feeling a bit sentimental.",
    "Elio: Is it because that you gave all the treasure to Nigel?",
    "Angelia: No, it's not about the treasures, but more about this vault itself. I have fond memories of this place.",
    "Elio: Fond memories?",
    "Angelia: When I was little, I was a mischievous kid. Back then, I loved to play hide-and-seek with uncle.",
    "Angelia: This treasure vault was one of my favorite hiding locations. Because if I were hiding inside, uncle would have to come find me himself.  \nWhenever he found me, he would hold me high above his head...",
    "Elio: So Princess Angelia and Regent Theodore are actually really close to each other?",
    "Angelia: ... We used to be. Somehow, that feels like a past from another life.",

    "Angelia: What is it?",
    "Elio: ...You...do you hate King Theodore now...?",
    "Angelia: Not at all... I'm just, extremely sorrowful. To be honest with you, the fact that I have to go against uncle makes me very, very sad.",
    "Angelia: ...I sound really pathetic, don't I?",
    "Elio: No, I don't think so...",
    "Angelia: Don't tell this to other people. If I am considered a weak princess, I won't have the authority to lead everyone into battle.",
    "Elio: ......",
    "Angelia: Elio, what's the matter? Why did you stop talking all of a sudden?",
    "Elio: I was just thinking...so this is the burden a ruler must shoulder. If that's the case, then Regent Theodore is also...",
    "Angelia: Yes, I believe uncle must've had a pretty rough time as well...",
    "Yamitsuki: Princess Angelia, so this is where you are.",
    "Yamitsuki: I would like you to fulfill your previous promise and help us clean up the remaining monsters.",
    "Angelia: Understood. I'll be on my way right...",
    "Elio: Wait, please allow me to go in place of Her Majesty.",
    "Angelia: Elio?",
    "Elio: The princess would probably like a bit more time here to reminisce about her memories of this castle. \n\nAfter all, Sir Sherlock is almost done removing the core, and the princess won't be seeing this castle anytime soon once we leave.",
    "Yamitsuki: Any help will do. Doesn't matter who it is.",
    "Angelia: Understood. Then I shall you take up on your offer. Elio, Good luck.",
    "Elio: Miss Yamitsuki, right? Let's go.",
    "Angelia: Wait...!",
    "Angelia: Thank you, Elio.",
    "Angelia: ...Is someone there? Who's that?",
    "Angelia: Hold it right there!",
    "Uzziah: ...You're able to predict my actions?",
    "Uzziah: You appear to be delicate, but it seems like that's not entirely the case.",
    "Angelia: ...Are you an assassin uncle sent to kill me?",
    "Uzziah: No, I am just a mere outsider. I don't have an ounce of interest regarding the civil war within the Carlos family.",
    "Angelia: Then why are you──",
    "Uzziah: I'm just here to make sure that your plans won't affect the Dragoneye Gem. However, it looks like you're only interested in the Rayzor.",
    "Angelia: Dragoneye Gem? Who in the world are you?",
    "Uzziah: There's no need for you to know. I'm someone who's existence should've long been erased by this world. \nThe fact that you've met me is itself a misfortune for you.",
    "Uzziah: ... All choices come with a price. Both you and your uncle chose the future of the kingdom and in turn, sacrificed one another.",
    "Uzziah: ...In my humble opinion, both of you are indeed incredible leaders.",
    "Yamitsuki: Look out!",
    "Izumi: Oops~ Somehow, through all that fighting, we ended up near the underground library~",
    "Elio: The underground library?",
    "Elio: Wait, the drawings on this wall...are they...Feather Clan?",
    "Izumi: Ho~ Elio boy recognizes the Feather Clan too? Lemme tell you a little secret; this is the Feather Clan's seal~",
    "Elio: ... Legend has it that the Feather Clan is the oldest of all demihuman species. Their flesh and blood contain pure Soul Energy.",
    "Izumi: That's~ right! The Feather Clan is extremely rare, yet they have such~ amazing abilities. No wonder they cost an arm and a leg on the market!",
    "Elio: However, there's still one thing I don't get. What's the \"seal\" you just mentioned...?",
    "Izumi: In other words, this door can only be opened by the blood of a Feather Clan member.",
    "Yamitsuki: Izumi, enough.",
    "Izumi: Ehh, why? Isn't all this talk about the Feather Clan super~ interesting?",
    "Izumi: A-ha, I remember! Previously, Yamitsuki's employer used her blood to open the door~",
    "Izumi: Are you still watching his door for him?",
    "Elio: So Miss Yamitsuki is a Feather Clan member? And who's this employer...?",
    "Elio: What exactly is in this underground library...",
    "Yamitsuki: Shut it. I've never trusted you, and I will never let you manipulate Nigel.",
    "Izumi: Ohh~ scawy~ Looks like I better scoot off first and let grumpy Yamitsuki here cool off a bit~",
    "Subordinate: Yamituski? Did something happen with Izumi?",
    "Yamitsuki: ...Nothing.",
    "Subordinate: So you guys still get on each other's nerves...",
    "Yamitsuki: Not a big deal. What is your business with us?",
    "Subordinate: Oh, right. There's something we need you to confirm back at the castle──",
