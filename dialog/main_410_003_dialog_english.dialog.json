    "Noblewoman: Hmph. No point in quibbling over a few ornaments. It'll all be a moot point in a few days, anyway.",
    "Naya: Dammit. The roads are all packed with Serafin goons.",
    "Angelia: There's always a way out, we just have to find it...",
    "???: Is the Queen resting in here?",
    "Angelia: That voice...",
    "Guard: Yes. If you need to leave a message, Miss, we'll take it to her on your behalf.",
    "Adelaide: I see... Her Majesty has always treated me well. I've come to wish her farewell. I owe her at least this basic courtesy.",
    "Adelaide: And you — You're telling me you'd obstruct me, a noble of the Twelve Houses, and make a mockery of my name in front of the Queen's face?",
    "Guard: N-no, of course not...!!",
    "Adelaide: Thank you. Then please do me the favor of bringing us some tea and refreshments.",
    "Adelaide: Adelaide Serafin at your service, Your Highness.",
    "Angelia: Please, don't lower your gaze before me... Things have changed, but your etiquette is still as flawless as it ever was.",
    "Adelaide: Etiquette is everything for a virtuous lady, no matter when or where.",
    "Adelaide: Moreover, I haven't been able to dissuade my father. I apologize for this humiliation, Your Majesty.",
    "Angelia: Your father's actions are his and his alone. I cannot hold you responsible for them. If it weren't for your advice... I fear even Dylan would have been tied up in this, too.",
    "Angelia: This is the first I've heard of your departure. Is this the Head of House Serafin's will?",
    "Adelaide: Father has...",
    "Guard: Your tea, Miss Adelaide.",
    "Adelaide: If you don't mind, Your Highness, perhaps we can drink while we talk... Cold tea would not befit your high standing.",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Naya: Right now? You feel like now's the time for a tea party?",
    "Adelaide: Shh... A virtuous lady knows when to remain silent.",
    "Naya: Huh...",
    "Angelia: Let's just drink it, Naya. We shouldn't let Adelaide's goodwill go to waste.",
    "Angelia: ...Mm... Such a soft, elegant aroma... Is this an Alder tea for relaxing the mind?",
    "Adelaide: It is. But as Your Majesty always remains calm in the face of trouble, it's little more than an adornment.",
    "Angelia: It's a shame we couldn't be drinking the Platon tea we used to have at our tea parties. That would have made for a truly special afternoon.",
    "Adelaide: Things are never quite as we would will them to be.",
    "Adelaide: Right now, for instance. The Twelve Noble Houses have betrayed the crown, and I couldn't live with myself if I were to stay in the palace any longer.",
    "Adelaide: ...And moreover, just as you thought, my father now hopes for me to return home.",
    "Angelia: Hopes? You mean... He's not pursuing you anymore? But these are no trivial matters, perhaps he has a different punishment in mind...",
    "Adelaide: Thank you. I understand your concern, Your Highness. But please don't worry. I've made my own decision to return.",
    "Adelaide: Once I'm back, I'll go to the prayer hall and confess. After that, my father is sure to stop watching over me so closely.",
    "Naya: But you're sure to be punished...",
    "Angelia: ...No. I think Adelaide has something else in mind.",
    "Adelaide: Nothing is for certain, and it's hard to know others' minds... The Noble Houses... have always had secret tunnels and escape routes.",
    "Naya: ...So you'll flee directly from the Serafin estate? That's real ballsy, I like the way you think!",
    "Angelia: ...Are you sure about this? Think carefully, Adelaide. If your father discovers this, then next time...",
    "Angelia: —Things will never be the same between you.",
    "Adelaide: ...Father has always doted on me. He knows his duty as a parent.",
    "Angelia: Then...",
    "Adelaide: That's exactly why the House of Serafin needs someone to preserve its honor... I cannot stand by and watch him abandon our principles.",
    "Adelaide: This... is how I'll protect our House.",
    "Angelia: ...I understand your decision. Then so be it.",
    "Adelaide: Thank you. Now, I apologize for leaving you both...",
    "Interrogating Soldier: ...Welcome back, Miss. The Head of House Serafin has been ardently awaiting your return.",
    "Adelaide: I had to stay a few more days. I was indebted to the Queen.",
    "Interrogating Soldier: Please, Miss, stay where you are.",
    "Adelaide: What is it? Father should be resting in his quarters. He shouldn't be disturbed right now.",
    "Interrogating Soldier: Uhh... I don't mean to offend, Miss, but my lord has given me orders. Everyone here is to be subject to interrogation, no matter who...",
    "Adelaide: Is that so? Then let's begin. However... These robes were given to me personally by the Queen while I lived in the palace.",
    "Adelaide: ...Should you insist on checking them, I trust you'll be willing to be held to account for overstepping your authority.",
    "Interrogating Soldier: N-n-no, not at all. My mistake, please, as you wish...",
    "Adelaide: ...There's tea in my trunk, conferred upon me by the Queen. Go get it for me. I expect the tea and refreshments to be ready before my father awakens.",
    "Retainer: Yes, Ma'am.",
    "Adelaide: Your Highness, Naya... You can come out now.",
    "Naya: That was close. I had my bowstring pulled taut the whole time...",
    "Adelaide: I'm sorry, I hadn't expected security to be so tight.",
    "Angelia: Wait. Do you hear voices...?",
    "Adelaide: The guards?! Watch out, Your Majesty!",
    "Adelaide: What are they doing here...",
    "Adelaide: Father must have mobilized his reserve troops while I was away.",
    "Angelia: Not to worry. We should get moving, fast.",
    "Adelaide: Yes. The prayer hall is right ahead, please come with me."
