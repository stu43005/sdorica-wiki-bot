    "Hyde: Naturally we have only the utmost respect for the Queen. We're here to advise you to work together with us.",
    "Angelia: We can talk, but at least see to it that Naya is all right, first...",
    "Zola: Ugh. No. 2 needs your response as soon as possible. I suppose you won't cooperate until she's already dead though, is that it?",
    "Hyde: Contain yourself, you're making this difficult.",
    "Hyde: She knows she faces certain death if Theodore returns. We ought to admire a friendship as firm as this. And so...",
    "Angelia: Is that... an insignia of the Twelve Nobles?",

    "Zola: This isn't part of our orders. Are you thinking of betraying the sect?",

    "Hyde: What are you doing?! You damn crazy girl...!",
    "Zola: You're nothing but a lousy dog at the bottom of the sect. All you know how to do is bark and bark, \"Second Parhelion\" this, \"Second Parhelion\" that!",
    "Angelia: So...",
    "Angelia: ...That settles that, then.",
    "Hyde: Always holding onto naive fantasies, even in situations as dire as this. Only you, Angelia.",
    "Zola: Heheh... What? Both sides are the same?",
    "Zola: Playing with fakes is cheating, Hyde Oust.",
    "Hyde: —It isn't a fake.",
    "Hyde: A long, long time ago... Many nobles had insignia just like this one.",
    "Angelia: You've gone to all this trouble, just to play a trick on me...?",
    "Hyde: You can sense it, but you're powerless to change. That was Theodore, and now it's you. As far as the sect is concerned, you're both the same. Front and back, both alike.",
    "Zola: ...No. The Carloses may all be equally detestable, but for the Second Parhelion, for the Feather Tribe—",
    "Zola: —Theodore can never, EVER be forgiven...!!",
    "Angelia: (Does the Second Parhelion hate my uncle just as much as Zola...?)",
    "Hyde: Yes, Theodore is truly despicable. I'm sure you've experienced his cruel methods up close and personal, no?",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Hyde: If you really wish to save yourself, you'll work together with the Dracontines. It's simple, all you have to do—is nod your head.",

    "Angelia: (—And if that's so...)",
    "Angelia: I am Queen of the Kingdom of the Sun. Even if my uncle is my enemy, I can't let darkness overrun the sun!",
    "Hyde: Another humdrum, boring answer, Angelia.",
    "Zola: So what~",
    "Zola: The more she resists, the sooner the sect will give up on her. Don't make us wait too long, now, Carlos.",
