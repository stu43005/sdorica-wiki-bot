    "Hugo: My master. I don't know if I should tell you any more than that.",
    "Naya: Why not ask this master of yours if you can tell us more?",

    "Naya: Why not?",

    "Nolva: U-uh, what Hugo means is that, he can't tell me anything either, except he has to protect me...",
    "Naya: Nolva, don't you think this all sounds a little fishy?!",
    "Nolva: Hmm... That's what Kittyeyes said, too...",
    "Nolva: But... I've gotten used to him now, and I know he means me no harm. He's not a baddie... P-please, believe me!",
    "Naya: ...If you say so...",
    "Hugo: It doesn't matter what you two believe.",
    "Naya: ......",
    "Nolva: ......",
    "Naya: Well, please wait here for your audience with the queen. I'll go report our arrival.",
    "Hugo: Must you really see the Queen and Nobles of the Kingdom of the Sun?",
    "Hugo: They've summoned you because they fear your power as the Monster Enchantress. You're in grave danger here, but there's still time for us to leave the palace if we go now.",
    "Nolva: Uhh... To be honest, I'm really nervous...",
    "Nolva: But Roger said that as long as I can persuade the queen to support me, I'll be able to save even more people, so... I have to try!",
    "Hugo: ......",
    "Hugo: ...You will be disappointed. Good and evil are absolute. If she needs persuading, that means the queen is not a good person.",
    "Hugo: —Not like you.",
    "Nolva: ...Gah...",
    "Imperial Guard: You may enter now.",
    "Hugo: ...Your mind is made up. Go ahead.",
    "Nolva: ...Yes! The queen has to believe us!",
    "Nolva: (Okay, Nolva, concentrate...!)",
    "Angelia: Are the heads of the Twelve Noble Houses all present?",
    "???: Your Highness, with the exception of the House of Aldric, all have arrived.",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "???: Your Highness?",
    "Angelia: (...Sione..)",
    "Angelia: ...We heard news yesterday that the daughter of the House of Aldric met with misfortune during a campaign in the East against the Monster of Judgment.",
    "Angelia: Ace fears his bereavement may impinge upon the affairs of the nation, and has thus requested to take leave of us. He has returned to his domain to mourn.",
    "???: ...I see. You are merciful as ever, Your Highness. But I hope that you will soon be able to harden your heart.",
    "???: For if the Monster Enchantress refuses to submit to your authority, she must be executed at once so as to prevent any trouble in future.",
    "Angelia: House Serafin, I believed we had made ourselves clear already. The Enchantress is the key to solving our monster crisis.",
    "Angelia: I called this meeting to convene our allies, not to make enemies.",
    "Serafin Head: Forgive me for saying so, Your Highness, but the Twelve Nobles already have an enemy.",
    "Angelia: ...Do you mean Elio?",
    "Serafin Head: Correct. He is of royal blood, after all, your kin.",
    "Serafin Head: All you asked was that the demihumans hand the murderer over to us for a fair trial. Every due courtesy was given. Yet Atlas refused!",
    "Angelia: Their library collapsed, and took many refugees to the grave with it. Even now we don't know if Elio still lives.",
    "Angelia: It's not unreasonable that Atlas should want to first concentrate on their own search and rescue efforts...",
    "Serafin Head: Can't you see that's just an excuse from those demihumans' leader? He's afraid to hand the culprit over, lest it damage his reputation.",
    "Angelia: ...Even were that so, it doesn't mean Nigel wants to make enemies of us. Otherwise he wouldn't have sent us Elio's manuscript.",
    "Serafin Head: Your Highness, if we indulge them we'll only be making things more difficult for ourselves down the road. Peace is something to be fought for—and now we must prepare to fight back.",
    "Noble: Yes. Those lowly commoners never dared to show such impudence before. Everyone remembers how peaceable our kingdom was back then.",
    "Angelia: I understand your perspectives, everyone. This will require much discussion; let us wait for Ace's return before we make a decision.",
    "Serafin Head: Very well, Your Highness. You will always have the backing of the Twelve Noble Houses.",
    "Nolva: U-umm... My name is Nolva Carpenter, I'm d-delighted to meet you, Your Highness...",
    "Noble: Who is this ignorant village girl! How dare she disrespect the queen?!",
    "Nolva: Ahh! I forgot, I-I'm so sorry!",
    "Angelia: Heh, that's quite alright. Are you the one who's been driving out monsters all over the land? Please accept my gratitude on behalf of the Kingdom of the Sun.",
    "Nolva: Oh, n-no, I'm not all that special...",
    "Angelia: Naya told me what happened in Totemtaff. If it weren't for you, I might have lost quite a few friends.",
    "Nolva: ...I'm just happy to be able to help.",
    "Angelia: Nolva, would you be willing to help us, to help our Kingdom?",
    "Nolva: Of course! I—",
    "Serafin Head: Just a moment, Your Highness. May I ask her a few questions of my own?",
    "Angelia: ...House Serafin, she is my honored guest. Please show your respect.",
    "Serafin Head: To be sure... As long as she is indeed honorable—and not an enemy of the Kingdom of the Sun.",
    "Angelia: What is the meaning of this?! I didn't give any orders!",
    "Serafin Head: Merciful and benevolent as you are, Your Highness, we must ensure your safety.",
    "Serafin Head: Miss Carpenter, you claim that you are capable of communicating with the monsters. Please would you tell us from where did you learn this ability?",
    "Nolva: I... I don't know. I just heard a voice all of a sudden...",
    "Serafin Head: A voice? What kind of voice?",
    "Nolva: Not a real voice... Uh, I... I can't describe it...",
    "Serafin Head: You all heard her. She won't speak the truth.",
    "Nolva: No! I really don't know...!",
    "Serafin Head: True gold can withstand flame, Your Highness. The facts are plain to see.",
    "Serafin Head: If this Miss Carpenter here is not a charlatan, then she is deliberately misleading the people, the throne, and the Kingdom!",
    "Hugo: Silence! She has been chosen, and you will not degrade her.",
    "Noble: You insolent pleb! How dare this bodyguard interrupt!",
    "Hugo: Ignorant, self-proclaimed descendant of Vendacti. Vendacti was the true charlatan—he betrayed everyone.",
    "Noble: You dare besmirch our name! Treason!",
    "Serafin Head: Guards! Take these traitors away!",
    "Angelia: Calm yourselves!",
    "Serafin Head: And before our very royal throne... This is an open declaration of war!",
    "Nolva: Hugo, stop!",
    "Hugo: As long as I still have breath in my body, do not touch her.",
    "Serafin Head: Would you still ignore the injuries done to our Kingdom, to our people, Your Highness? Our nation grieves, and our people need your leadership!",
    "Angelia: ......",
    "Angelia: ...In the name of the Sun, have them arrested.",
    "Nolva: Ahh! It can't be..."
