    "Soohyeon: ...What about Pearl Manor? Have you heard anything?",
    "Toyokuni: I haven't heard anything about that, but...\nSoohyeon, you're no longer protected as a tournament contestant.",
    "Toyokuni: Please, you should be thinking more about yourself right now, not about Pearl Manor.",
    "Soohyeon: ...Okay...",
    "Toyokuni: And... there's something else I think you have the right to know.",
    "Toyokuni: Because you're no longer a tournament contestant, Tindoiimu has made it to the finals.",

    "Tindoiimu: Gone well...? Soohyeon? Do you even know her at all?",
    "Tindoiimu: Do you really think she's as innocent as she makes herself seem?",
    "Pang: No... it is true, I do not know Soohyeon very well.",
    "Pang: And yet, for her to come clean at that moment... was no small feat of courage.",
    "Tindoiimu: She's not the only courageous one around here!",
    "Tindoiimu: And no one forced her to say anything, it was her own decision!",
    "Pang: Are you alright? This isn't like you...",
    "Pang: It seems like you're trying to... suppress something.",
    "Tindoiimu: Don't overthink it.",
    "Pang: I'm sorry, maybe I'm overstepping my bounds. It is just... I have dealt with similar emotions in the past, so I think I can understand...",

    "Disappointed Person: Oh man, I can't believe Miss Soohyeon was a bewitcher...\nWithout her here, what's the point?",
    "Chiyuki: (Yes, it's a shame what happened to Soohyeon, but... I'm Hanazono Chiyuki! It's my job to raise everyone's spirits!)",
    "Chiyuki: I am aware this is quite the somber moment. It is truly awful what transpired...",
    "Chiyuki: And yet, they say every cloud has a silver lining! And I would say, having our tournament finals today is a blessing from the Holy Dragon himself!",
    "Disappointed Person: A blessing from the Holy Dragon?",
    "Chiyuki: Yes! I'm referring to the formation of our great Alliance, of course!",
    "Chiyuki: Remember, hundreds of years ago there was an evil dragon.",
    "Chiyuki: A dragon of harsh, blazing flames and gnashing teeth, it brought misfortune and disaster upon the people! That is, until the Holy Dragon appeared─",
    "Chiyuki: They underwent countless battles, but finally, with the help of the citizens of this very land, the Holy Dragon defeated the evil dragon!",
    "Chiyuki: Unfortunately, the Holy Dragon also used up all of his own power. He sank into the earth, becoming celestial energy and birthing the Mythics!",
    "Chiyuki: And, as we all know, the Mythics started out at war with one another, which angered the great dragon.",
    "Chiyuki: And it was at this juncture that the Mythics put aside their differences and came together, creating this very alliance.",
    "Hestia: Wow, to think our homeland went through such a tumultuous beginning...",
    "Chiyuki: And now, our arbiter, the arbiter chosen by the Holy Dragon's will, must lead us through these difficult times.",
    "Excited Audience: That's right... the Holy Dragon knows best!",
    "Faithful Audience: You're right, let's continue the tournament! The Holy Dragon won't lead us astray!",
    "Chiyuki: Now, let's not be hasty! As is tradition, the finals are a bit different from previous events.",
    "Chiyuki: Our two finalists have shown their strength in past battles, no doubt, and yet the arbiter must not only be strong... they must also be just!",
    "Pang: Just...",
    "Chiyuki: Yes, no matter the trials and tribulations, the Alliance arbiter must uphold the principles of morality and justice at all times!",
    "Tindoiimu: So we're not fighting? How are we supposed to battle using our 'morals'?",
    "???: Through, Trial of, Dream Flower...",
    "Maeok: Ah, chieftain of the Tapir Tribe, I haven't seen you in twenty years, and yet you haven't aged a day!",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Aha! This door, twenty years, never opened.\nAnd yet, twenty years, Alliance, much has changed...",
    "Tapir Chieftain: As have you, Arbiter Maeok.",
    "Maeok: Yes... with all the changes a day brings, twenty years brings even more.",
    "Maeok: ...And I'm old now, it seems...",
    "Maeok: Anyhow, these two are our new tournament finalists.",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Welcome, you two.",
    "Chiyuki: Everyone, this here is our own Keeper of the Dream Flower~ \nThe ever-elusive, Tapir Chieftain!",
    "Tindoiimu: Keeper of the Dream Flower...?",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Many years ago, the Holy Dragon, lost wings, birthed the Udumbara... Left behind, keeper of the Udumbara, witnessed the birth of Alliance...",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Passed on will of Alliance... Carved holy talismans, made Dream Flower, selected each arbiter...",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Old tribe, no change, forever keeper.",
    "Tindoiimu: So, you mean we do this 'Trial of the Dream Flower', and then this keeper of the Udumbara chooses who the next arbiter is...?",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Yes. Keeper of the Udumbara, pass down Holy Dragon's will. Udumbara flower, proof of will, keep protecting, East Alliance.",
    "Tindoiimu: (Protecting the East Alliance? Yeah, right...)",
    "Chiyuki: Now, may the Tapir Chieftain bring our two finalists to the trial!",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Before that, I have... one wish.",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Although I... seldom come outside. I know, a thing or two... of this world. The beauty, radiance.",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Today, here, I see... such radiance.\nIf I may, ask something of, such an elegant maiden... this trip, not in vain.",
    "Chiyuki: Elegant maiden... me? Oh, chieftain, you are too kind!",
    "Chiyuki: (I know what comes next... I've said it before...)",
    "Chiyuki: (But no, this time will be different!)",
    "Chiyuki: Yes, of course we can be friends!",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Friends... Oh, no...",
    "Tapir Chieftain: May I have... your autograph?",
    "Chiyuki: A-Autograph? Um, sure. Does anyone have a piece of paper?",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Thank you, very much. I will, treasure this... forever.",
    "Chiyuki: (I guess she didn't want to be friends after all... Same as always.)",
    "Chiyuki: Yah, it's him...!",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Hmm? Who?",
    "Chiyuki: Um, nothing! I-I'm very excited for the Trials of the Dream Flower!",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Aha... Yes, I shall, lead the way...",
    "Chiyuki: (Finally... but what is my savior doing here!?)",
    "Tapir Chieftain: Please, follow me...",
    "Yao: Wait!",
    "Yao: He... has no right to be in this tournament!",
    "Pang: Yao!?"
