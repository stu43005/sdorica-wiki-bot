    "Lio: Sis Angel has asked me in private to monitor and investigate the people in the Infantry. She wanted to find the spy who leaked our strategies.",

    "Leah: If not for the sheer amount of names, I wouldn't have interfered to help him out, or even went as far as asking sis Tica for help.",
    "Hyde: Didn't she ask me to find out who the spy is?\nYet she secretly asked you to do it as well... \nSo she is suspicious about me from the start?",
